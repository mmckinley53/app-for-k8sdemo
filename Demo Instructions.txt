/* Instructor Tools 
1. Docker For Windows w/ Kubernetes enabled
2. Docker Hub account
3. Visual Studio Code (IDE)
4. cmder (Command Window)

/* To see a window with 3 horizontal cmder terminals:
1. Start cmder in administrative mode (start, type in 'cmder', search displays cmder icon, right click on cmder icon, select "Run as administrator")
2. Click on Cmder icon upper left corner of terminal. 
3. From pull-down menu select "Active Console":"Restart or Duplicate":"Split to Bottom"
4. To start Powershell in one of the terminals just type "powershell" at the cmder prompt (lamba)

/* Docker exercise
1. Open a terminal emulator (e.g., CMD, Powershell, cmder, etc.)
2. cd /user/<username>/K8SDemo/app/amf 


/* 1st Section: Docker Ops Demo

/* Get the docker version
PS: docker -v

/* List the local Docker images
PS: docker images

/* Pull an images
PS: docker container pull ubuntu:latest

/* Check if the image has been downloaded
PS: docker images

/* Launch the container and run a command
PS: docker exec -it ubunt:latest /bin/bash
#

/* From inside the container, run a command
# ping 8.8.8.8

/* Exit the container
# exit
PS: 

/* List the running containers
PS: docker container logs

/* Attach to the running container
PS: docker container exec -it <container id> /bin/bash
#

/* Exit the container
# exit
PS: 

/* Stop the container
PS: docker stop <container id>

/* See if the container is still there
PS: docker container ls -a

/* Kill the container
PS: docker stop <container id>

/* Docker DEV demo

/* Open a browser and introduce Docker Hub:
/* Use browser to navigate to your Docker Hub repository (e.g., mmckinley5712/amf-ctr)
/* Click Explore tab to search for enodeb: select raraya - not much description
/* Go back to Explore tab and search for Python and click on Official Image checkbox

/* Pull a Docker image from Docker Hub
PS: docker pull 






/* Git hub stuff for developers
/* Create a local repository 
PS: cd /users/mmckinley/K8SDemo/apps/amf /* cd to local source code folder
PS: git init                    /* create local repository
PS: git config --global user.name 'Mike McKinley'
PS: git config --global user.email 'mmckinle80@yahoo.com'
PS: git add Dockerfile          /* put file into staging area
PS: git status
PS: git rm --cached Dockerfile /* removes file from staging area
PS: git add *.yml               /* add all yml files to staging area
PS: git add .                   /* add ALL files to staging area
PS: git status                  /* shows all files in the 'changes to be committed' status
/* Make a change in one of the files in the folder then display the status: 
PS: git status 
/* Git has detected the changes and issued a warning that there are "Changes not staged for commit" and must be added again
/* To fix this issue, you must add the file(s) into the staging area again:
PS: git add .                   /* add the files to the staging area including the modified file
PS: git status                  /* shows that all files are ready to be committed.
/* This command opens a vim editor to allow a comment to be inserted (see vim for instructions) 
/* then commits the file(s) to the "local" repository
PS: git commit   
/* To prevent a file or a folder from being added to the staging area:
/* 1. Create a file called .gitignore
/* 2. Add the filename of the file that you want to ignore: log.txt
/* 3. Add the directory names of the folders that you want to ignore: \dir1
PS: git add .
PS: git status                  /* notice that log.txt and \dir1 are not included in the list


                                








/* To run a command continuously from one of the terminal windows in cmder:
while(1){ kubectl get pods;start-sleep -seconds 2;clear }

while(1){ curl 192.168.0.146:30002/api/hostname;start-sleep -seconds 2;clear }

while(1){ kubectl logs --selector app=amf ;start-sleep -seconds 2;clear }
